									<h2>Introduction</h2>
									<!-- <p>maecenas feugiat ex purus, quis volutpat lacus placerat</p> -->
								</header>
								<hr />
								<p>US election 2020 is coming soon. Since the end of 2018, thousands of polls on this cycle have been taking place all across the US. 
									Exploring the data about these polls gathered and published in <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls-page/president_polls.csv">fivethirtyeight</a> (and accessed on February 18th), 
									some intresting facts are found and shown here! </p>
								
								<p>
									Befor moving into the interesting insights, I would like to show some details about the data first. The dataset involves data of every poll,
									which consists of detailed questions about preference to presidential candidates. For each question, there are multiple choices (of preferred candidates), and 
									the supporting rate for each choice is given. The candidate who has the greatest supporting rate is considered to win in one question. 
									And the candidate/party that wins most questions in a poll is considered to win the poll. When n candidates all wins some equal most number of 
									polls, each of them is considered to win 1/n of the poll. In this way, we can to some extent count the candidates' wins.
								</p>

								<p> <span style="color:red">Note:</span> There is inevitably some limitation in this scoring scale. For instance, Mr. Trump, as the only popular Republican candidate and current US president,
								are much more likely to be one choice of a question, which would reasonably lead to more wins in questions and then polls. 
								To make more sense, it would be wise not to directly compare Mr. Trump with other candidates based on count of wins. 
								Rather, it would make more sense to make partison comparison or compare within Democrats.

									<h2>Who is most likely to win Trump?</h2>
									<!-- <p>maecenas feugiat ex purus, quis volutpat lacus placerat</p> -->
								</header>
								<hr />
								<p>Donald trump, the current US President and republican candidate, is one of the clear favorites.
									The Democrats, on the other hand, are still competing against each other for candidates.
									Among them, 
									Bernie Sanders,
									Pete Buttigieg,
									Elizabeth Warren
									, and Joe Biden are most likely to become opponents of Mr Trump. 
									Here, we are going to compare their approval ratings (with Mr trump's) to find out who is most likely to win. </p>
								
								<h3>Candidates' counts of wins</h3>
								<p> 
									The first chart below shows the candidates' count of wins over time. Since Trump as a most common choice in questions is much more likely to 
									have more wins, it's unfair to compare his wins directly with the Democrats'. So his line is set with some opacity and added just as a reference. 
									Among the 4 Democratic candidates, Joe Biden seems to win more most of the time. Yet in recent months, he similar counts of wins to Bernie Sanders. 
									Another interesting finding is that, Trump had fewer counts of wins than both Biden and Sanders in September 2019. 
									Considering his big advantage as a popular option, this drop might result from some particular events. 
									Also, it's easy to notice that the counts for all Democrats greatly droped while that of Trump's climbed in December 2019, 
									which is likely to be led from some other particular events.
								</p>

								<h3>Select a candidate from the legend to compare with Trump</h3>
								<p> 
									By selecting Democratic candidates in the legend, we can further compare their performances in polls directly with Donald Trump in the second chart. 
									The chart shows the selected candidate's average supporting rate over Trump in every month. (And when all the 4 Democrats are selected, it shows their overall average support over Trump.)
									As we can see, although Biden and Sanders had higher supporting rate than Trump most of the time in the past year, Trump is more favored 
									in the recent month. When directly compared with Trump, Biden seems to be the best in the past. As for Buttigieg, he has never been directly 
									compared with Trump in any recorded question.

									<h2>A closer look at the victories</h2>
									<!-- <p>maecenas feugiat ex purus, quis volutpat lacus placerat</p> -->
								</header>
								<hr />
								<p>
									In this section, we would like to take a closer look at the victories of every candidate and try to some underlying interesting facts.
									Here by "victories", we mean the polls in which the candidate is the one (or at least one of those who) get[s] the highest supporting rate in the most number of 
									questions.
								</p>
								<h3>Is sponsoring affecting the polls' results? </h3>
								<p>
									The left chart below shows the sponsoring rate of the "victories". With about 63% of all the polls unsponsored, it's easy to find that 
									the sponsoring rate of Biden's victories is somehow abnormal. He has only 47% of all the polls he has won unsponsored! 
									In contrast, Sanders, as another popular Democratic candidate, has 74% unsponsored victories. 
									Though there is no evidence that sponsoring has influenced in any poll, the wide differences of the sponsoring
									rates are still out of ordinary. 

								</p>
								<div id="vis2" width="300px"></div>
								<h3>Grades of the polls </h3>
								<p>
									Further select a candidate's bar in the left chart, 
									we can check the grades of the polls he/she wins shown in the right. 
									And when all bars are selected, it shows the overall distribution of grades, ranging from D to A+.
									As we can see, most of the recorded polls are in the grade B/C or A-. Comparing with others' grades distribution,
									it's also apparent that Donald Trump has much more lower (especially B/C) graded polls than others.  
									This could imply that his advantage might not be so great as some people think.

								<hr />
								<p>
									In this section, we further research on the geographical and temporal distribution of the polls.
								</p>
								<h3>Geographical distribution</h3>
								<p> 
									In the left chart below, we show the distribution of polls and winning parts by state. Notice that 
									the states are ordered by the number of electoral votes, which implies the importance of the state in the votes.
									It's clear that the number of polls does not completely match the number of electoral votes. Especially for California
									and New York, with the most and the third most number of electoral votes, there are not as many polls there as expected. 
									One possible reason is that, both of the states have clear tendency towards the Democrats, 
									which raises no interests in the media.
								</p>
								<div id="vis3" width="300px"></div>
								<h3>Temporal distribution</h3>
								<p> 
									Further select a bar in the left chart, the temporal distribution of polls in the corresponding state will be
									presented in the right chart above. 
									Though overall there is some unequality 
									in the diribution, generally in every state the polls 
									are uniformly distributed over time. 
									Yet we can find that compared to other states with a number of polls, 
									Califonia didn't have a poll until August 2019, which is quite slow for 
									a state with most number of electoral votes. 
									And this might also be explained by its clear overaall leaning
									to Democrats.
